# FAC-OVERFLOW

https://facoverflow.herokuapp.com/

Our goal this week was to make a forum which only authenticated users could access. They can log in or sign up on the home page. 

Posts and comments cannot be edited at this time, they draw from the pre-populated database.

Users can log out.

If user tries to go to the forum page without authentication then they are redirected to the log in page.
